Thesis-dependencies
===================

As a big fan of self-contained projects, this repo is meant to act as an 
optional submodule of my Thesis project, providing access to a (admittedly, 
outdated) required subset of the Boost libraries as well as the Gtest 
framework.  If, for whatever reason, you don't already have or are unable to 
install these components on your system, here are the required sources.
